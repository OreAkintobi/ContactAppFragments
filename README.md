# ContactMe

This is my ContactMe App. Contacts are saved in local (Room) and FireStore databases simultaneously and deleted simultaneously. All contacts can be viewed.

It has been updated slightly; most activities have been replaced with fragments, with a navcontroller for moving between fragments and passing arguments as well.

The app conforms to MVVM standards, with viewmodels available where needed.

Databinding is used to connect data to the layouts.

A lot of boilerplate code has been eliminated.

Pending Firebase authentication, search and edit contact functionalities.

Adapter will also be refactored to accommodate multiple contact view types
