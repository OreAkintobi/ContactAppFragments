# contactAppFragments

This is my ContactMe App. Contacts can be added, saved in a local (Room) database and deleted. 

It has been updated slightly; most activities have been replaced with fragments, with a navcontroller for moving between fragments and passing arguments as well. 

The app conforms to MVVM standards, with viewmodels available where needed. 

Databinding is used to connect data to the layouts. 

A lot of boilerplate code has been eliminated. 

Pending Firebase authentication and Firestore database
