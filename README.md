# ContactMe

This is my ContactMe App. Contacts can be added, saved in a local (Room) database and deleted.

It has been updated slightly; most activities have been replaced with fragments, with a navcontroller for moving between fragments and passing arguments as well.

The app conforms to MVVM standards, with viewmodels available where needed.

Databinding is used to connect data to the layouts.

A lot of boilerplate code has been eliminated.

Pending Firebase authentication and Firestore database
